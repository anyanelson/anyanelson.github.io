				Hello. As I said before, my name is Kyla Curtis. 
                 I am now three years old. 
                 My mommy is a Artist and my daddy works for Macy's.
			</p>
				In my freetime I like to code and try to read.
				I know it sounds weird that I can write and not read but what you don't know is I am learing how to read. 
			<p>
				I have nine sister and two brothers. When I get older I want to be famous and rich. When I get rich I will be on TV!!!

			Kyla Curtis is not a real person (at least that 
			I know of). This is all fiction.
